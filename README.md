# Hg-MATE-Db: Hg-cycling Microorganisms in Aquatic and Terrestrial Ecosystems Database

<h3 class="section-title underline">Background</h3>
<p>Microorganisms play a significant role in regulating the form and fate of mercury (Hg) in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Microbes with the hgcAB gene pair can produce a more toxic, and bioaccumulative form of Hg, methylmercury (MeHg). Microbes that possess the mer operon can demethylate and/or reduce Hg species as part of a detoxification mechanism. Improved techniques for capturing hgcAB and mer presence and diversity are necessary for identifying the major microbial players in environmental Hg cycling. The primary goal of the database Hg-MATE is to provide an up-to-date collated resource of Hg-cycling genes from pure culture and environmental microbial genomes and meta-omic datasets. The version 1 of the database contains an hgcAB dataset with resources for identifying key microbial producers of the toxin MeHg. Future versions of the Hg-MATE-Db will also include (i) hgcAB sequences from high-throughput sequencing and clone datasets and (ii) a mer dataset, which will contain resources for identifying genes of the mer-operon that encode for demethylation of organomercurials (merB), reduction of inorganic Hg(II) (merA), as well as operon regulation (merR), and Hg transport across the cell (merTPC). </p>

<h3 class="section-title underline"> Brief description of the gene catalogue</h3>
The hgcAB gene catalogue of the version 1 (Hg-MATE-Db.v1.01142021.xlsx) was released 14 January 2021 and contains a catalogue of 1053 unique HgcA/B amino acid sequences. There, HgcAB amino acid sequences are categorized into four types depending on whether they were encoded in pure culture/environmental microbial isolates (<b>ISO</b>), single-cell genome sequences (<b>CEL</b>), metagenome-assembled genomes (<b>MAGs</b>) and environmental meta-omic contig (<b>CON</b>). Included in the database are amino acid sequences of HgcA, HgcB, and concatenated HgcA and HgcB. If hgcB is not co-localized with hgcA in the genome and/or cannot be identified, then ‘na’ will be listed in the ‘HgcB’ sequence column. We collated the HgcAB databases from <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.541554" target="_blank"><b>Gionfriddo et al. 2020</b></a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.00299-20" target="_blank"><b>McDaniel et al. 2020</b></a> and added HgcAB amino acid sequences pulled from three public data repositories: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" target="_blank"><b>NCBI GenBank</b></a>, <a href="https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/" target="_blank"><b>JGI-IMG GOLD</b></a> <a href="https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/" target="_blank"><b>GTDB release 89</b></a> obtained on 23 October 2020. HgcAB amino acid sequences were identified in these databases by hmmsearch with HgcA and HgcB HMM profiles from <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.541554" target="_blank"><b>Gionfriddo et al. 2020</b></a>. Detailed description of the catalogue, how it is structured and how it was created is provided in the README.pdf of the hg-mate_v1 folder. 

<h3 class="section-title underline">Resources</h3>
 The resources within the database v1 include:
● ‘Hg-MATE-Db.v1.01142021.xlsx’: Excel spreadsheet catalogue with amino acid sequences and organism metadata 
● FASTA files containing amino acid sequences of HgcA (‘_HgcA.fas’), HgcB (‘_HgcB.fas’), and concatenated HgcA-HgcB sequences (‘_Hgc.fas’) from pure culture/environmental isolates, single-cell genome sequences, and metagenome-assembled genomes (‘ISOCELMAG’)
● FASTA formatted alignments of amino acid sequences of HgcA (‘_HgcA_msa.fas’), HgcB (‘_hgcB_msa.fas’), and concatenated HgcA-HgcB sequences (‘_Hgc_msa.fas’) from pure culture/environmental isolates, single-cell genome sequences, and metagenome assembled genomes (‘ISOCELMAG’) 
● Hidden Markov models of aligned HgcA (‘_HgcA.hmm’), HgcB (‘_HgcB.hmm’), and concatenated HgcA-HgcB (‘_Hgc.hmm’) built from pure culture/environmental isolates, single-cell genome sequences, and metagenome-assembled genomes (‘ISOCELMAG’). 
● Three reference packages that can be used to identify and classify: 1) the cap-helix encoding region of HgcA (Hg-MATE-Db.v1.01142021_ISOCELMAG_HgcA_CH.refpkg), for example in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132, this encompasses the CdhD-like encoding region, sites ~37-156 of HgcA (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/F0JBF0); 2) full HgcA (Hg-MATE-Db.v1.01142021_ISOCELMAG_HgcA_Full.refpkg); and 3) concatenated HgcA and HgcB (Hg-MATE-Db.v1.01142021_ISOCELMAG_HgcA-HgcB.refpkg). Each reference package contains sequence alignments, hmm model, phylogenetic tree, and NCBI taxonomy.
